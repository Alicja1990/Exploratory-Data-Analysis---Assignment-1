# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Assignment-1

Hi, welcome to my plot scripts. 

There are two short comments from me. 

1. In each of my .R files you can find the same script to download, unzip and prepare dataset. 
Probably you will need it just once, but you can find it in each, so that you can start from any of the plots. 

2. I see the labels on y axis (weekdays) in my national language. 
I hope R will convert it to the language set on your PC, but if not, you will see "Cz, Pt, So", instead of eg. "Thu, Fri, Sat". 

Thank you for your attention. Enjoy!
